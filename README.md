# Chemistry-Assistant

This is my attempt to make a python program which compiles and intertwines many developers' code to make the world of chemistry easier :)

Make sure you have both master.py and periodictable.py in the same folder before running!


The base program is currently executable, but there are a number of things to improve on:
  - Each individual electron is hard coded in a simple list (i.e. 1s^1, 1s^2). I think there is a way to simplify this using matrices.
  - Exceptions, such as the electron configuration of Chromium and Copper, and the electron configuration of ions in the d-block are still unaccounted for (don't want to have to hard code exceptions)
  - I have included several elements without agreed upon chemical properties (i.e. Oganesson) which I may take out at a later date.
